# data-1033-program

* Data for the 1033 program can be found on the DLA Disposition Services eReading Room [website](http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/EFOIA-Privacy/Pages/ereadingroom.aspx#1033).
* The NY Times posted an interactive article titled, ["Mapping the Spread of the Militaryâ€™s Surplus Gear"](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/us/surplus-military-equipment-map.html?_r=1)

## Questions I'd like to answer
* Which state received the most support? How much support are the items worth?
* What did the states receive? (e.g. type of supplies)
* Is there a typical cadence to when supplies are released (or sold?) to states?
* Are there any patterns for states that receive more from the 1033 program compared to states that receive less?
* Do states, or counties, that receive 1033 support have higher crime rates?
* Are there any counties, or states, that have received disproportional support from 1033 when compared to their populations? (e.g. A county with a low population has received some of the most expensive items through the 1033 program.)
